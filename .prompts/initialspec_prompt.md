# Initial Spec

I am buidling a modern macro nutrient and calorie counter. The intention is for the user to be able to quickly and easily enter in the foods they eat throughout the day so they can keep track of their target goals for calories and macro nutrients.

The app should be modern, user friendly, and easy to use. 

It should have a view for the day the user wants to input the meals. By default their should be 3 meal categories - Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner. The user should be able to edit these defaults and also create new meals.

The user should be able to search and add food from the same page as the daily diary page.

The user should have the option of creating custom foods that can be saved to their profiel

The user should be able to create custom meals from food that is saved to their profile.
